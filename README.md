## 1. Determining the Main Idea
The main idea is a statement that summarizes the author's point of a paragraph, passage, article, speech, or video. The main idea can be supported by details, examples, facts, and opinions. Main ideas can be identified by analyzing titles and subtitles, and the beginning and ending sentences of a paragraph. Skim over a passage to locate these items, write them down, and think about why they are there. Read the entire passage, then ask, "What central idea does the author explain or support?"
