## 1. Determining the Main Idea
The main idea is a statement that summarizes the author's point of a paragraph, passage, article, speech, or video. The main idea can supported by details, examples, facts, and opinions. Main ideas can be identified by analyzing titles and subtitles, and beginning and ending sentences of a paragraph. Skim over a passage to locate these items, write them down, and think about why they are there and why the author chose to include them. Read the entire passage, then ask, "What central idea does the author explain or support?"
