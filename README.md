## 1. Determining the Main Idea
The main idea is a statement that summarizes the author's point of a paragraph, passage, article, speech, or video. The main idea can be supported by details, examples, facts, and opinions. Main ideas can be identified by analyzing titles and subtitles, and the beginning and ending sentences of a paragraph. Skim over a passage to locate these items, write them down, and think about why they are there. Read the entire passage, then ask, "What central idea does the author explain or support?"

### Make a Diagram
When making a diagram state the topic, then list supporting details below it. Use the supporting details to declare the main idea.

## 2. Clarifying and Summarizing
Clarifying means having a clear understanding of what you read or saw. A good way to make sure you understand the material you have just read is to ask yourself questions about the material. In your answers to your questions, restate the content in your own words.
<br/>
Summarizing means restating what you just read with fewer words. When summarizing, state the main ideas and most important details in your own words, reducing what you just read into a brief report of its general ideas.
<br/>
Write a summary to clarify your understanding of the main ideas and important details.
